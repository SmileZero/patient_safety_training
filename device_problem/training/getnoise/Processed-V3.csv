attached over the pull wire cannula during manufacturing. the push catheter was kinked by the distal end. a functional evaluation was not performed due to the condition of the returned device. the investigation concluded that tortuous conditions due to patient anatomy or customer manipulation can cause the delivery system to bend/coil leading to interference between the guide catheter and push catheter. this can cause the guide catheter to separate from the pull wire cannula during stent deployment\, resulting in failure to deploy the stent. therefore the most probable root cause is

302,4596319,"complaint conclusion: as reported\, a 7f exoseal device for vascular closure was used for hemostasis after a percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) for an acute myocardial infarction (ami). the patient expired the following day from an unknown cause. the patient was a female. the death certificate and a procedural report are unavailable. a retrograde approach was used for this case. the physician had achieved certification on the use of the exoseal vcd but it is unknown how many times the physician has used the exoseal prior to this case. the vcd showed no visible signs of damage and was prepped according to the ifu. femoral artery suitability was verified on angiography. the angle of access was between 30 and 45 degrees. the arteriotomy was not in or near an area of calcified plaque or near a stented segment. the vessel diameter was >/= to 5mm in diameter. the target femoral site was not previously closed with any closure device or manual compression less than 30 days prior to this procedure. there was no evidence of pre-existing hematoma\, arteriovenous fistula\, or pseudoaneurysm at the access site prior to exoseal vcd use. after the pci\, the exoseal vcd was inserted into a sheath introducer. then\, the exoseal with the sheath introducer was retracted as a unit\, and then\, the back-flow from the bleed back indicator stopped. after that\, there was a strange movement with the indicator window when the physician moved the exoseal back and forth. the physician then confirmed that the indicator window changed to a black-black pattern\, so he pressed the deployment button to deploy the plug. the physician felt it took a bit longer time than usual to achieve hemostasis. the location of the plug might have moved away from the vessel. after the procedure\, the patient developed severe bleeding. the following day\, the patient passed away. the actual cause of death is unknown. the physician comments\, â¿the patient moved a lot after the procedure. the patientâ¿s death might have been caused by severe bleeding. rebleeding might have occurred even by applying manual pressure for hemostasis. rebleeding might have not occurred if angioseal or perclose were used.â¿ additional information was provided by the affiliate. the patient was treated with a blood transfusion following the bleeding event. the bleeding started approximately 3 hours after the plug deployment. the color of the indicator window was not stable. there was a space between the plug and the vascular wall. there was no suspicion of the plug being deployed intravascularly. there was no resistance/friction experienced as the exoseal vcd was advanced through the sheath. there was no difficulty connecting the sheath with the exoseal vcd. the physician did not have his thumb placed on the plug deployment button during retraction. the indicator window did not show any red color during retraction. the exoseal was securely locked with the sheath. the deployment button was fully depressed and flush against the handle. proper indication was observed in the indicator window. excess force was not needed to depress the button. the exoseal vcd and sheath were removed as a single unit from the patient approximately 1-2 seconds after depressing the button. the plug did not fall out of the exoseal shaft upon removal from the patient. the plug was not found partially deployed or inside the shaft. the patient did not show any symptoms of distal blood flow occlusion. pulsatile bleeding of the puncture site was not observed immediately after removal of exoseal and sheath. there was only oozing of the puncture site easily treated with light pressure. the patient did not develop a hematoma after plug deployment. the product was not returned for analysis. review of lot 17070043 revealed no anomalies during the manufacturing and inspection processes that can be associated with the reported complaint. according to the products instructions for use (ifu)\, users are warned not use the exoseal vcd if the device appears damaged or defective in any way. rebleeding following initial hemostasis requiring intervention is a known adverse event following the use of an exoseal device. furthermore\, users are instructed to assess the insertion site\, as per hospital protocol\, and ensure that the site remains clean and dry. based on the limited information provided\, it is not possible to draw a conclusion about a clinical relationship between the device and the event. however\, procedural factors may have contributed to the reported event. without the return of the device for analysis\, the reported customer complaint could not be confirmed and no determination of possible contributing factors could be made. based on the

non-secretory fibrous pseudocapsule. seromas have been reported with both dacron and ptfe grafts\, most common when they are place in subcutaneous locations and are sometimes referred to as a weeping graft. early seromas are not uncommon with prosthetic a-v grafts and frequently resolve without intervention. as this event may not be a true seroma\, given the fact that the weeping was not contained within the subcutaneous tissue it is plausible that the observed event was the ultra-filtered serum described above and therefore is a known vascular access occurrence/complication reported with ptfe grafts. the ptfe component of the hero 1002 is manufactured by bard pv. the surgeon did not specify if bard pv was one of the ""other ptfe grafts"" that he sees this type of weeping. although it was stated that the patient was not on anticoagulants\, the comorbidities and other medical history or current medications are unknown for this patient; therefore no conclusion can be made as to the impact of their history or medications may have on the observed event. the operative notes indicate\, ""the patient did bruise a quite a bit throughout the entire tunnel of the ptfe graft."" as such\, this could be indicative of some other (unknown) systemic underlying condition for this particular patient which could be related to the duration of the weeping that was observed. the root cause for this event is unknown. if the event does in fact represent a seroma it is a known potential complication of the hero graft which is outlined in the device's ifu. seromas are common among all arteriovenous grafts\, and do not suggest that there is a deficiency in the hero or the hero ifu. there is no evidence to suggest that an error occurred in processing or production. there is no

503,4566459,"per the instructions for use (ifu)\, device embolization is a known potential complication associated with the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (tavr) procedure. there are multiple patient and procedural factors that alone or in combination can cause or contribute to ventricular embolization\, including improper positioning prior to deployment\, poor image intensifier angle\, poor coaxial alignment of the valve/delivery system\, a narrow\, calcified sinotubular junction\, minimally calcified aortic leaflets\, and loss of pacing capture. the thv training manuals instruct the operator on proper positioning and deployment of the valve\, including all procedural and anatomical considerations. physicians are extensively trained by edwards before they are qualified to use the sapien xt thv. training includes patient screening\, device preparation\, approach\, deployment\, imaging\, procedure-specific training manuals and proctored procedures. the correct alignment and positioning of the device at the point of deployment is emphasized as a key factor to the placement and fixation of the device. operators are also instructed to use fluoroscopy as the primary method of visualization for positioning and deployment. in patients with high-risk anatomical features for ventricular embolization (i.e. small\, calcified stj\, minimal leaflet calcification)\, bav may provide indication of potential balloon movement during valve deployment. in this case\, procedural factors (possible undersizing of the valve)\, in addition to patient factors (severe annular and native leaflet calcification) likely contributed to this event. the ifu and training manuals have been reviewed and no inadequacies have been identified with regards to warnings\, contraindications\, and the directions/conditions for the successful use of the device. complaint histories for all reported events are reviewed against trending control limits on a monthly basis\, and any excursions above the control limits are assessed and documented as part of this monthly review. no corrective or preventative actions are required.,as reported by our (b)(6) affiliate\, a 26mm sapien xt valve was successfully deployed 50:50 aortic/ventricular (a/v) via the transfemoral approach. during post deployment angiogram\, the valve â¿fellâ¿ in to the ventricle. the procedure was converted to open surgery. the xt valve was explanted and a bioprosthetic valve was implanted. the patient was transferred in stable condition. it was perceived that possible under sizing of the valve (26mm xt valve verses a 29mm xt valve) may have contributed to this event. the correct valve size was difficult to determine due to the severe amount of calcification. the patientâ¿s native annulus measured 24mm to 25mm by transesophageal echocardiogram (tee). severe annular calcification and severe native leaflet calcification were noted.",[the patient was transferred in stable condition.],stable condition

however\, a review of the instructions for use (ifu) and specifications was conducted during the course of the investigation. the complaint was identified through a american heart association journal article. journal article provides pictures and imaging of the incident. per the journal article\, """"(b)(6) year-old woman presented to the emergency department of the hospital complaining of chest pain. she had a remote history of a hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident complicated by pulmonary embolism\, for which a gunther-tulip inferior vena cava (ivc) filter had been placed 6 years previously. on the abdominal ct scan\, one of the struts from the patientâ¿s ivc filter was not visualized with the remainder of the ivc filter. the patient was taken to the operating room\, where exploration of the pericardial space demonstrated a small laceration of the right ventricular free wall and a linear 3-cm metallic foreign body consistent with the missing ivc filter strut. the provided journal article\, pictures and imaging of the incident was sent for outside expert clinical review. the finding and impressions are as follows: findings: an article titled "" fracture and embolization of an inferior vena cava filter strut leading to cardiac tamponade"" is provided. ct and x-ray images demonstrate an approximately 3.5cm long filter leg in the pericardial space anterior and inferior the right ventricle and surrounded by fluid. a ct image through the filter shows three primary and four secondary filter legs. all legs are equidistant when the missing leg is accounted for. no ivc perforation or tilt is suggested. the ivc diameter equaled the aortic diameter\, which is usually 2cm in this location. impression : although the article aptly describes a case of cardiac tamponade from a fractured and embolized primary filter leg\, the filter does not have the expected appearance of a tulip filter. a fractured tulip filter would demonstrate only three primary legs or three primary legs and eight secondary wires grouped adjacent the primary wires. the appearance would depend on where the scan plane intersected the filter. hypothetically a severely constrained tulip filter could have all neighboring secondary wires overlap and appear as four. the probability of this occurring is low and the ivc was not stenotic on the provided image. the possibility cannot be entirely dismissed because no other filter\, particularly one available in the us prior to 2003\, matches the imaging. from the journal article\, an abdominal ct shows the gunther-tulip ivc filter in place but with one strut missing from the filter formation. additional imaging shows a linear foreign body in the left anterior pericardial space. an intraoperative photograph is provided to show a puncture of the right ventricular free wall. finally a photograph shows a fractured stent strut that was recovered from the patient's body during the surgical procedure. the appearance of the strut is consistent with the struts of the gunther-tulip ivc filter. per specification\, the quality control (qc) personnel inspects 100% packaged product for visible damage. it also instructs qc personnel to 100% inspect to verify that filter has not released from the delivery system. the device is packaged with an instructions for use (ifu); which gives device description\, intended use\, contraindications\, warnings\, precautions and potential adverse events pertaining to use of the gunther-tulip ivc filter. step 10 of the placement procedure states that ""proper position can now be verified by injection of contrast medium."" step 14 states\, ""perform a cavagram to verify filter position\, and then withdraw the system."" we are inconclusive as to the root cause of the strut fracture in this case. we have notified the appropriate internal personnel and will continue to monitor for similar events. per the conclusion of the quality engineering risk assessment (qera) further risk reduction will not be conducted at this time.","[per american heart association article: ""a (b)(6) woman presented to (b)(6) complaining of chest pain., the patient recovered uneventfully from surgery.,per american heart association article: ""(b)(6) year-old woman presented to the emergency department of the hospital complaining of chest pain., per the journal article\, """"(b)(6) year-old woman presented to the emergency department of the hospital complaining of chest pain.]",american heart association article;woman;chest pain;surgery.;american heart association article;year-old woman;emergency department;chest pain;journal article;year-old woman;emergency department;chest pain

675,4613071,"per the instructions for use\, conduction system injuries (heart block) which may require a permanent pacemaker are potential adverse events associated with balloon aortic valvuloplasty\, deployment of the prosthetic valve\, and the overall tavr procedure. according to the valve academic research consortium (varc) guidelines\, the close anatomical relationship between the aortic valve complex and the branching atrioventricular bundle may provide an explanation for these complications of the tavr procedure. according to literature review\, and as documented in a technical summary written by edwards\, atrioventricular conduction disturbances after tavr are associated with many patient related and procedural related factors\, including pre-operative co-morbid status\, the degree and bulkiness of aortic valve and annular calcification\, inter-ventricular septal thickness\, pre-existing electrocardiogram abnormalities\, the depth of prosthesis implantation\, and the profile of the implanted prosthesis. unlike conventional avr\, where there may be localized trauma due to decalcification of the annulus and/or suture placement in the proximity of the av node or the bundles\, tavr may cause conduction abnormalities through mechanical impingement of the conduction system by the prosthesis. the mechanisms of the development of heart block after tavr are well documented and described in the literature. it is also documented that pre-existing heart block is common in patients undergoing tavr or surgical avr and another 4-6 % will develop postoperative heart block\, potentially requiring a permanent pacemaker. in this case\, the cause of the reported complete heart block is likely related to the mechanisms described above\, in conjunction with the patientâ¿s pre-existing lbbb. the ifu and training manuals have been reviewed and no inadequacies have been identified with regards to warnings\, contraindications\, and the directions/conditions for the successful use of the device. complaint histories for all reported events are reviewed against trending control limits on a monthly basis\, and any excursions above the control limits are assessed and documented as part of this monthly review. no corrective or preventative actions are required.,during a subclavian tavr procedure\, following valve deployment the patient went into complete heart block\, which required the placement of a permanent pacemaker. the patient had a history of left bundle branch block (lbbb) prior to the procedure.,.","[the patient had a history of left bundle branch block (lbbb) prior to the procedure.,.]",history;left bundle branch block;lbbb;procedure.

be done to alleviate the customer's issue. no specific remarks were made during the assessment regarding any more ac reactions during plasma rinseback. preventative maintenance was performed on the device. no issues were found during pm. ac management is covered in the trima operator's manual. the manual cautions the operator to monitor the donor throughout the procedure in order to respond quickly to donor reactions. donor reactions to ac are a known possible side effect. root cause: no defect was found with the device. further investigation indicates there was no software issue\, as initially suspected\, and that the software performed as intended. a definitive root cause cannot be determined at this time. the known possible side effects for ac reactions are: mild tingling of the lips\, lightheadedness and nausea. in rare cases trembling\, twitching or increase in heart rate may occur.,investigation: the device was tested for functionality\, with no problems identified. no additional reports have been received for this device regarding donor reactions. a review of the last year of service history for this device\, indicated no other reports related to this issue. four run data files (rdfs) were analyzed for these events. in all four procedures\, the maximum concurrent plasma collection ended approximately halfway through the procedure. during the plasma collection\, much of the ac is going to the plasma product\, and therefore the ac infusion rate to the donor is less. when plasma collection has completed\, the ac infusion rate to the donor increases\, as the donorâ¿s plasma is now being returned. since plasma collection is ending about halfway through the procedures\, donors have higher infusion rates for the second half of their procedures. from the information provided\, it sounds like the patients are not reacting to the ac at all until the plasma rinseback protocol is turned on. the rdf review showed that the ac infusion rate during rinseback is about equal to / or less than (never greater than) the ac infusion rate during platelet only collection. the ac infusion rate decreases over the course of plasma rinseback. it is not clear why donors are reacting during plasma rinseback\, but not prior to rinseback. some donors have normal ac reactions (not severe) at the end of plasma collection due to the increase in infusion rate. this event has been referenced in a software issue tracking system for further analysis. root cause: software issue.,the customer reported that over the last weeks since the installation of trima software version 6.06 and the activation of the plasma rinseback feature\, they have seen several donors experience 'severe' ac reactions during the plasma rinseback. per the

(b)(6) 2014 - black bumps formed around the rectum\, which had to be removed and sent to the lab. the results were inconclusive\, and i was told to get a biopsy. dr. (b)(6) suggested i get a long needle shot in the mesh area more than once to numb the area. i choose not have this done because i am concerned it could numb the organs in this area and cause more problems. (b)(6) 2014 - i was sent to dr. (b)(6) \, colon rectal specialist\, who treated me like i was a senile old woman and as if i was imagining all the symptoms. he told me to go home\, go to bed\, and stay there. (b)(6) 2014 - i was sent back to dr. (b)(6) by my family doctor\, dr. (b)(6) thinking that possibly the rectum problem may be caused from the mesh. he scoped me. he put me on a 6-week sitz bath of witch hazel and aloe vera with no relief. (b)(6) 2014 - dr. (b)(6) prescribed a combined anti-inflammatory cream and numbing agent. i was scoped again\, and once again there was no relief. (b)(6) 2014 - dr. (b)(6) prescribed a combined anti-inflammatory cream and numbing agent. i was scoped again\, and once again there was no relief. in between all of this\, i have had shingles and bronchitis because my body is in a weakened condition. my life has no quality. i do not think i could physically survive the removal of the mesh and my surgeon does not want to do the procedure. i could die or end up in a nursing facility. i have been to the doctor 6 times as well as to my family doctor every three months since the initial surgery.","[\, colon rectal specialist\, who treated me like i was a senile old woman and as if i was imagining all the symptoms.]",colon rectal specialist;senile old woman;symptom

implants and is listed in the ifu as such. intracardiac migration of ivc filters is a rare but potentially fatal event. possible causes for filter migration includes mega cava (ivc diameter >28 mm)\, wire entrapment during central venous catheter placement\, ""sail"" effect (cranial migration) of large clot burden within the filter\, mechanical device failure\, and operator error. some studies suggest that strenuous physical activity and increased intra-abdominal pressure can lead to the fracture and migration of ivc filters. physiologic causes of migration may result from temporary dysmorphism of the inferior vena cava including bending\, coughing or valsalva maneuvers resulting in dislodgment of the filter. migration of ivc filters has been demonstrated when the presence of an overburden of thrombus in the vasculature occurs that exceeds the devices ability to exert radial force toward the vessel walls and maintain optimal positioning and in patients who were in a dehydrated state when the filter was placed and have since re-hydrated thereby expanding the diameter of the vena cava. without return of the device for analysis or films of the reported event there is not enough information to draw a definitive clinical conclusion between the device and the reported event. there is no evidence of manufacturing or design issues that contributed to the event. based on the lack of information and the inability to assign or determine a root cause no corrective actions will be taken at this time.","[on examination the patient was in respiratory distress\,

1497,4628805,"based upon the investigation findings\, the reported type iii-b is confirmed based on clinical assessment of available records. adequate medical documentation and suboptimal imaging studies were available for this review. product use was incongruent with the ifu due to: the 65 degree angulation of the aortic neck. cautionary product use conditions that might have contributed to this event included: patent ima and extra renal artery; circular calcifications at bifurcation\, neck and iliacs; circular ulcerative plaque (blood lumen) within the aortic sac. patient factors that might have contributed to this event included the use of antiplatelet therapy due to the reduced ability to clot blood. during implantation\, there was evidence to support a report of a persistent type i-a endoleak; this finding could not be radiographically confirmed. a difficult deployment\, and the subsequent vessel damage to the common femoral artery was acknowledged; the vessel was successfully repaired. one day post implant\, the patient suffered a non st elevated myocardial infarct due to a combination of chronic disease and acute blood loss due to the endovascular repair. the first subsequent procedure\, a diagnostic cardiac catheterization\, was performed. the patient was managed medically until two months later underwent a four-vessel bypass procedure. one month post implant\, there was evidence to support a type ii endoleak which resulted in the patency of the highly calcified\, false blood lumen. this system was supported by a right renal accessory artery (right distal aorta) and proximally by the inferior mesenteric artery (proximal aorta). a type iii-b endoleak at the superior margin of the false blood lumen\, just below the visceral aorta\, could not be entirely ruled out. the sac remained stable. over time\, the false blood lumen lost some patency from both its feeders\, and the sac size remained stable at eight months post implant. only after 12 months post implant\, did the false lumen loose its supply from the right renal artery; the inferior mesenteric artery status was difficult to assess. the false lumen thrombosed distally\, but the superior margin appeared irregular\, which supported evidence of a type iii-b endoleak. there was interval sac growth at this time. the second subsequent procedure was confirmed. operative notes support a type iii endoleak. another manufacturer's bridge stents was placed\, which successfully mitigated the endoleak. the patient was discharged home on the first post-operative day\, on antiplatelet therapy. a manufacturing record review was performed\, the lot met all release criteria with no related issues or deviations that would explain the reported event. the lot usage history showed all units have been consumed and no other units from this lot were involved in any similar event. the product labeling was reviewed and confirmed that the reported event is adequately captured in the existing labeling. based upon the investigation findings\, the root cause could not be determined based upon available information. however\, medical documentation review indicated device use was incongruent with ifu due to 65 degree angulation of the aortic neck. cautionary product use conditions that might have contributed to this event included: patent ima and extra renal artery; circular calcifications at bifurcation\, neck and iliacs; circular ulcerative plaque (blood lumen) within the aortic sac. patient factors that might have contributed to this event included the use of antiplatelet therapy.,it was reported that approximately 26 months post implant of a bifurcated device and a suprarenal aortic extension\, the patient developed an endoleak. the physician elected to implant a competitor device (gore). the patient was reported to be doing well and went home day 1 post op.,endologix continues to investigate the reported event. endologix will submit a supplemental report in accordance with 21 cfr 803.56 when additional information becomes available. device remains implanted in patient.","[one day post implant\, the patient suffered a non st elevated myocardial infarct due to a combination of chronic disease and acute blood loss due to the endovascular repair., patient factors that might have contributed to this event included the use of antiplatelet therapy.,it was reported that approximately 26 months post implant of a bifurcated device and a suprarenal aortic extension\, the patient developed an endoleak.]",day post implant;non st elevated myocardial infarct;combination;chronic disease;acute loss;endovascular repair;factor;event;use;antiplatelet therapy.;month post implant;bifurcated device;suprarenal aortic extension;endoleak

1553,4482323,"(b)(6). a manufacturing evaluation was completed: screw is broken at the threaded shaft. the screws were made of stainless steel. the examination of the raw-material inspection sheets of the supplier and manufacturing documents of the producer showed no deviation in relation to the chemical composition\, microstructure and mechanical properties. the material of the screws is in compliance with the international standards. the dimensions fo the investigated screws were checked using a digital sliding caliper and fond to be incompliance with the technical drawings of the producer and ao/asif specifications. the fracture characteristics are macroscopically visible and indicate fatigue breakage. weakly visible lines of rest were noticed on the facture surface. the screw heads do not show any indicates for instability in a fracture situation. when examining the three fracture surfaces of the screws using scanning electron microscope (sem)\, the fracture behaviors were identified. the cracks started at the circumference of the core diameter of the screws and ran into the material. at a higher magnification\, fatigue striations were observed at the crack propagation zones and almost over the entire fracture surfaces. each striation represents the successive position of an advancing crack front and they originate from cyclic loads (load and unload during walking). the presence of these striations is a clear indication of a fatigue process. secondary crack initiation sites were observed just opposite of the initial crack initiation on all three fracture surfaces. the areas with dimples correspond to the residual forced fracture zone. sem observations and findings showed that the failures of the screws were caused by fatigue and overload. based on the topography of the fracture surfaces of the screws\, it can be concluded that the implants were subjected to low alternating bending loads (two-sided). constant alternating bending loads / load cycles (during walking) led to the fatigue of the material\, then to a first crack and finally to the overload respectively to the fatigue fracture of the screws. the screws could not resist the applied force which finally led to the material overload / fatigue failure. a failure resulting from either a material defect or the manufacturing process can be excluded. device was used for treatment\, not diagnosis. if information is obtained that was not available for the initial medwatch\, a follow-up medwatch will be filed as appropriate.,event date: unknown. additional product code: hwc. implant date: reported as (b)(6) 2014\, exact date is unknown. the device was received\, the investigation could not be completed\, and no conclusion could be drawn\, as product is entering the complaint system. no non-conformance reports were generated during production. review of the device history record(s) showed that there were no issues during the manufacture of the product that would contribute to this complaint condition. device was used for treatment\, not diagnosis. if information is obtained that was not available for the initial medwatch\, a follow-up medwatch will be filed as appropriate.,device report from synthes (b)(4) reports an event in spain as follows: it was reported there were three broken cortical screws after a month of implantation. the patient was discharged and the patient did not support after intervention. the patient underwent a revision procedure on (b)(6) 2014 and the devices were explanted. this is report 1 of 3 for (b)(4).",[the patient underwent a revision procedure on (b)(6)],procedure

1570,4469717,"according to the instructions for use (ifu)\, cardiovascular complications\, including perforation or dissection of vessels which may require intervention\, are potential adverse events associated with the transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure. according to literature review\, and as documented in technical summary written by edwards â¿vascular complicationsâ¿\, vascular complications are a well recognized complication of the transfemoral tavr procedure in this elderly population with multiple co-morbidities. edwards has reviewed many reports\, including screening data records and source documentation of vascular complications and has found that the root cause is typically related to a combination of vessel size\, tortuosity and calcifications. although the incidence is decreasing with smaller sheath/delivery system sizes and physician experience\, there will continue to be cases in which vascular complications will occur. the thv physician training manuals instruct on procedural considerations for sheath insertion with regards to proper screening critical to reducing vascular complications. the training manual instructs the operator on proper sheath insertion and withdrawal techniques\, including pre-dilating the vessel with the edwards dilators. it also notes that calcification may reduce lumen diameter and limit or prevent transfemoral passage of the devices. the ifu contraindicates patients with ilio-femoral vessel characteristics that would preclude safe placement of sheaths such as severe obstructive calcification or severe tortuosity. pre-procedure screening and assessment of the femoral/iliac artery internal diameters will enable the clinician to determine if the sapien valve can be delivered transfemorally. assessment of location and amount of circumferential calcium will aid in determining areas of reduced vessel diameters. the operators are trained to measure minimum vessel diameter taking calcium into account. the physician training manual also lists the minimum recommended vessel size for each size device. despite the best screening tools\, a small percentage of patients will have femoral/iliac vessels that are not amenable to the trans-femoral approach or where increased resistance is encountered during insertion of devices. in many cases\, the vessel minimum luminal diameter (mld) may be borderline or below the indicated size. in addition\, significant calcification and/or tortuosity\, not always appreciable on imaging\, could be contributing factors to the event. the minimum required vessel diameter for a 20 fr sheath is 7mm. in this case\, despite multiple attempts to obtain additional information\, the minimum luminal diameter of access vessel\, the access vessel degree of calcification\, and the access vessel degree of tortuosity remain unknown. it is possible that the resistance with the delivery system through the sheath contributed to the dissection. the ifu and training manuals have been reviewed and no inadequacies have been identified with regards to warnings\, contraindications\, and the directions/conditions for the successful use of the device. complaint histories for all reported events are reviewed against trending control limits on a monthly basis\, and any excursions above the control limits are assessed and documented as part of this monthly review. no corrective or preventative actions are required at this time.,as reported by (b)(6) affiliates\, during the transfemoral procedure\, the 29mm novaflex+ delivery system was introduced in the 20f esheath. however\, the valve would not go through the sheath. the system was retracted but the sheath was kept in position. a 22fr dilator was introduced inside the sheath in order to expand it. a second valve and delivery system was prepped and inserted through the sheath. the valve was deployed successfully. post procedure the patient was brought to the sicu. three hours post procedure the patient became extremely hypotensive and her abdomen became swollen. she was brought back to the cath-lab where a dissection at the level of the iliac was noticed. a stent was put in but the bleeding continued. vascular surgery was called;

1577,4621193,"as reported from our (b)(4) affiliate\, 6 hours after a transfemoral tavr procedure\, the patient died from ventricular bleeding and annular rupture. a balloon aortic valvuloplasty (bav) was performed with a 23mm balloon. there was no contrast leakage into the left ventricle (lv)\, and the sinus of valsalva (sov) did not seem to be â¿pressedâ¿ by the balloon. therefore it was decided to implant a 26mm sapien xt valve with 1ml less than nominal volume. after the bav\, the blood pressure (bp) returned to normal. a second bav was performed; however the recovery of vital signs was not as rapid and the patientâ¿s bp was in the 50â¿s mmhg. vasopressors were given and the bp rose to 220mmhg. thereafter\, the bp could be controlled and the vital signs became stable. the 26mm sapien xt valve was implanted in a 40:60 aortic/ventricular position. transesophageal echocardiography (tee) showed mild paravalvular leak\, no abnormality was observed in the circumference of the aortic valve\, and pericardial effusion was not observed. post valve deployment\, the patientâ¿s bp descended into the 40â¿s mmhg\, but recovered to the 60â¿s mmhg about two minutes later. the bp dropped to the 30â¿s mmhg and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (pcps). was initiated. a pericardial effusion was detected with tee and a pericardiocentesis was performed. the vital signs temporally recovered and the bp rose to 250mmhg\, but then it dropped to the 20â¿s mmhg. pcps was resumed and the patientâ¿s bp was about 80â¿s mmhg under pcps support. bleeding from the substernal site did not stop and the patient was converted to emergency open chest surgery. bleeding from the rvot and the rv apex were observed. a repair was attempted\, but the bleeding could not be controlled and the pcps was converted to cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb). after aortic cross-clamping\, cardiac arrest was induced with cardioplegia solution and the rvot bleeding was repaired. the cross-clamp was released and hemostatic condition was checked. bleeding around the left coronary cusp (lcc) in the left ventricular outflow tract (lvot) was observed. the aorta was cross-clamped again and hemostatic suturing around the lcc was performed. the bleeding was difficult to manage. the cpb was converted to pcps and the patient was transferred to icu. six hours post procedure\, the patient was passed away due to the bleeding of ventricle rupture. a physician commented that he reviewed the cine image of the tavr procedure and found an image of the pacing lead piercing the apex during the lead insertion. the cine image also showed pericardial effusion during the first bav. it was suspected that the bleeding around the left coronary cusp (lcc) in the left ventricular outflow tract (lvot) was caused by over-sizing of the valve. the patientâ¿s annular diameter measured 19.9mm by 25.7mm on ct with an annular area of 411mm2. the native valve was described as mildly calcified.,per the instructions for use (ifu) cardiovascular injury\, such as perforation or damage (dissection) of vessels\, ventricle\, myocardium or valvular structures\, is a known potential complication associated with the tavr procedure. according to the thv training manuals\, risk factors for acute aortic rupture/dissection in the tavr procedure include significant valve over sizing (i.e. =4mm) in the presence of severely calcified aortic root and obliterated sinuses. the sapien valve relies on native valve calcium to securely anchor to the annulus. despite this beneficial aspect of calcium\, bulky calcium can increase the risk of calcific nodule displacement into the vasculature\, which can lead to vascular injury. at times the extent and distribution of calcium can impair ease of delivery of the valve\, correct positioning of the valve\, deployment of the valve and procedural success. in this case\, as reported it was thought that the annular rupture was caused by over sizing of the sapien xt valve. the ifu and training manuals have been reviewed and no inadequacies have been identified with regards to warnings\, contraindications\, and the directions/conditions for the successful use of the device. complaint histories for all reported events are reviewed against trending control limits on a monthly basis\, and any excursions above the control limits are assessed and documented as part of this monthly review. no corrective or preventative actions are required.","[bleeding from the substernal site did not stop and the patient was converted to emergency open chest surgery., the cpb was converted to pcps and the patient was transferred to icu., six hours post procedure\, the patient was passed away due to the bleeding of ventricle rupture.]",substernal site;emergency open chest surgery;cpb;hour post procedure;bleeding;ventricle rupture

1614,4491110,"upon removal of the 16fr sheath after transfemoral implant of a 23mm sapien xt valve\, a vessel perforation was noted in the left external iliac artery. the artery was repaired with a covered stent. at the time of the report\, the patient was stable. the patient was a dialysis patient with marginal vessel size. the operator believed the patientâ¿s vessel degradation made the vessel more vulnerable to injury.,according to the instructions for use (ifu)\, cardiovascular complications\, including perforation or dissection of vessels which may require intervention\, are potential adverse events associated with the transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure. according to literature review\, and as documented in a clinical technical summary written by edwards lifesciences\, vascular complications are a well recognized complication of the transfemoral tavr procedure in this elderly population with multiple co-morbidities. edwards has reviewed many reports\, including screening data records and source documentation of vascular complications and has found that the root cause is typically related to a combination of vessel size\, tortuosity and calcifications. although the incidence is decreasing with smaller sheath/delivery system sizes and physician experience\, there will continue to be cases in which vascular complications will occur. the thv physician training manuals instruct on procedural considerations for sheath insertion with regards to proper screening critical to reducing vascular complications. the training manual instructs the operator on proper sheath insertion and withdrawal techniques\, including pre-dilating the vessel with the edwards dilators. it also notes that calcification may reduce lumen diameter and limit or prevent transfemoral passage of the devices. the ifu contraindicates patients with ilio-femoral vessel characteristics that would preclude safe placement of sheaths such as severe obstructive calcification or severe tortuosity. pre-procedure screening and assessment of the femoral/iliac artery internal diameters will enable the clinician to determine if the sapien valve can be delivered transfemorally. assessment of location and amount of circumferential calcium will aid in determining areas of reduced vessel diameters. the operators are trained to measure minimum vessel diameter taking calcium into account. the physician training manual also lists the minimum recommended vessel size for each size device. despite the best screening tools\, a small percentage of patients will have femoral/iliac vessels that are not amenable to the trans-femoral approach or where increased resistance is encountered during insertion of devices. in many cases\, the vessel minimum luminal diameter (mld) may be borderline or below the indicated size. in addition\, significant calcification and/or tortuosity\, not always appreciable on imaging\, could be contributing factors to the event. the minimum required vessel diameter for a 16fr sheath is 6.0mm. in this case\, the patientâ¿s access vessel mld was 6.0mm and of borderline size for the 16fr esheath. the access vessel mld borderline size\, moderate degree of calcification\, and friable vessels from renal disease are likely contributing factors to the event. the ifu and training manuals have been reviewed and no inadequacies have been identified with regards to warnings\, contraindications\, and the directions/conditions for the successful use of the device. complaint histories for all reported events are reviewed against trending control limits on a monthly basis\, and any excursions above the control limits are assessed and documented as part of this monthly review. no corrective or preventative actions are required at this time.","[at the time of the report\, the patient was stable., the patient was a dialysis patient with marginal vessel size.]",time;dialysis;marginal vessel size

(b)(4).,(b)(4). summary: (b)(6) has had parkinsonâ¿s disease since she was (b)(6). deeply unhappy as a result of her symptoms and the lack of effect from the medication\, she chose to have deep brain stimulation surgery 10 years later. she reports on the stereotactic procedure\, her initial euphoria and the variable experiences after his. how bionic does she feel now? reported events: one (b)(6) female patient underwent right side deep brain stimulation (dbs) for parkinsonâ¿s disease in (b)(6) 2012. the patient experienced a pleasant relaxed feeling on the left side of the body immediately upon implantation. it was noted that this was due to local stimulation from among other things\, the surgical fluid. parkinsonâ¿s disease symptoms reportedly disappeared for a short time. it was stated that the patient experienced initial euphoria following surgery. six weeks after implant\, the surgical fluid was reportedly reabsorbed\, and the parkinsonâ¿s disease symptoms returned. stimulation was then started. voltage was increased slightly every 4 to 6 weeks from 1.7 to eventually 2.2 volts. the patient stated that although the voltage was increased slightly every month\, she noticed relatively little effect. the involuntary movements in the neck and shoulder had disappeared\, but the patient was â¿rather stiffâ¿ and needed the same dose of medication as prior to surgery. six months after the surgery\, the patient felt more inhibited and unhappier than ever before. the patient was stiff and could only go about daily activities after great thought and very slowly at that. the patient stated â¿it was as if a harness was closing inâ¿ on her. the patient felt greatly disappointed. it was noted that the patient experienced hysteria and the parkinsonâ¿s disease symptoms started â¿slowly taking holdâ¿ of the patientâ¿s body once more. the patientâ¿s health care provider (hcp) then decided to stimulate a slightly shallower contact on the electrode and to increase the voltage further at the same time. after two months\, the patient had almost reached the maximum voltage of 3.5 volts; this helped and gave the patient enough movement on the left side. stimulation was reportedly keeping the patientâ¿s left side under reasonable control; however\, the patient then required levodopa and benserazide to â¿slow downâ¿ parkinsonâ¿s disease symptoms on the right side. unfortunately\, this led to overstimulation of the left side; the patientâ¿s left foot drop made walking almost impossible. therefore\, the patientâ¿s right side symptoms were investigated almost one year after implant. the patient was observed after 12 hours without any medication or stimulation. the patient stated that when stimulation was stopped\, she became dizzy and felt strange tingling sensations in her head. the patient felt that her eyes were â¿vertically rather than horizontally aligned.â¿ an extreme tremor almost immediately developed in the left arm and leg\, worse than ever before. the patient tried grabbing her left arm with her right and when she finally managed to do this\, her entire body began to shake. the patient was then able to switch stimulation back on. the patient â¿limped out of the hospital with her left foot dragging on the floor\,â¿ but was reportedly happy. the patientâ¿s right side reportedly responded well to medication following the observation. the source literature did not include any specific device information. further information has been requested;

1796,4380568,".,this case report from united states was derived from medical literature on (b)(4) 2014 \, article entitled ""laparoscopic management of hysteroscopic essure sterilization complications: report of 3 cases."" it refers to a (b)(6) female patient who had essure (fallopian tube occlusion insert) inserted for elective sterilization and a displaced left tubal microinsert was visualized in hysterosalpingogram. later\, during laparoscopic removal\, the device was adherent to the peritoneum with a small amount of adhesions. authors report 3 cases of essure hysteroscopic sterilization complications that were referred to their minimally invasive gynecologic surgical service and successfully managed laparoscopically. (refer to company case numbers: 2014-181925\, 2014-181926 and 2014-181927). case 1: a (b)(4) nulliparous woman who underwent an uncomplicated hysteroscopic sterilization procedure with essure\, had a 3-month follow-up hysterosalpingogram (hsg) notable for a displaced left tubal microinsert with an appropriately placed right tubal microinsert. the patient was asymptomatic at the time of this finding. the patient's medical and surgical history was significant for idiopathic gastroparesis for which she had a gastric pacer. after the patient was counseled as to her treatment options\, she elected to undergo laparoscopic removal of the misplaced micro-insert with bilateral tubal ligation. the patient's reoperation took place approximately 4 months after the initial hysteroscopic sterilization procedure. intraoperatively\, the misplaced microinsert was discovered in the right posterior cul-de-sac\, adherent to the peritoneum with a small amount of adhesions to overlying bowel epiploica . the adhesions were easily lysed with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection using the laparoscopic scissors. monopolar energy was not applied because of the gastric pacer. approximately 3 cm of the isthmic portion of the fallopian tube was coagulated with the bipolar forceps during the bilateral tubal ligation\, especially near the corneal region where the microinsert was initially placed. the patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uncomplicated postoperative course. authors comment: we report successful laparoscopic removal of microinsert from complicated hysteroscopic essure sterilization beyond the 12-week postoperative period. in this case\, the microinsert was located in the right posterior cul-de-sac with adhesions attached to the surrounding bowel epiploica and peritoneum. these adhesions were easily lysed laparoscopically with only a small amount of fibrosis noted around the displaced microinsert. follow-up 10-dec-2014: the global ptc number was provided. follow up 15.dec.2014: ptc investigation results were provided. ptc global number: (b)(4). final assessment: since no product was returned to us for investigation\, we were unable to perform an investigation of the actual device involved in this complaint. typically\, we would inspect the micro-insert to confirm that all parts are accounted for and inspect the device to look for any manufacturing deficiencies. since we have no valid lot number for this case\, we were unable to conduct a review of the manufacturing batch record. we are unable to confirm any quality defect or device malfunction at this time. final risk classification: risk category v. medical assessment: this ptc was initiated due to a request for confirmation of quality. according to case information\, during laparoscopic removal\, the device was adherent to the peritoneum. the reported adverse events are not indicative of a quality deficit per se. no batch number was reported. without this information no batch signal cluster review in the gpv database for a more detailed statistical medical evaluation is possible. neither batch number nor complaint sample were available for further technical investigation. the technical assessment concluded unconfirmed quality defect. in summary\, there is no reason to suspect a causal relationship to a potential quality deficit based on this report. follow-up 29-dec-2014: to date there has been no response from the author to the company's request for the batch number. company causality comment: this case report derived from medical literature article entitled ""laparoscopic management of hysteroscopic essure sterilization complications: report of 3 cases"" refers to a (b)(6) female patient who had essure (fallopian tube occlusion insert) inserted and during hysterosalpingogram performed three months after placement\, it was found out that the left tubal micro-insert was displaced. the event\, interpreted as device dislocation\, is serious due medical importance and listed in the reference safety information for essure. during essure micro-insert therapy there is a risk that the device could move out of fallopian tubes\, this movement could be an expulsion (into uterus or out of the body) or dislocation (distal fallopian tube or peritoneal cavity). in this case\, the patient had a 3-month follow-up hysterosalpingogram (hsg) notable for a displaced left tubal microinsert with an appropriately placed right tubal microinsert. then the patient elected to undergo laparoscopic removal of the misplaced micro-insert with bilateral tubal ligation. intraoperatively\, the micro-insert was discovered in the right posterior cul-de-sac\, adherent to the peritoneum with a small amount of adhesions to overlying bowel epiploica. the procedure occurred well without complications. given the nature of dislocation\, causality is assessed as related to essure use and since intervention was required to remove the devices\, the case is regarded as incident. technical analysis concluded unconfirmed quality defect. there is no reason to suspect a causal relationship to a potential quality deficit. no further information is expected.,.","[the patient was asymptomatic at the time of this finding., after the patient was counseled as to her treatment options\, she elected to undergo laparoscopic

1 device was located intramural under the serosa due to partial perforation. all reported events are listed in essure's reference safety information and were considered non-serious\, except for the reported partial uterine perforation which is serious due to medical importance. unintended pregnancies may occur during any contraceptive use and have been reported in women with essure micro-inserts in place. some of these pregnancies occurred due to patient non-compliance\, which included failure to return for the essure confirmation test to determine if the inserts are in the correct location and tubal occlusion is present. in this case\, essure was replaced after a device expulsion and a transvaginal ultrassond (tvu) was performed to confirm placement; the reporter believed the position of the devices was misinterpreted in this exam\, since patient became pregnant and a partial perforation was diagnosed during a laparoscopy. although pregnancy in this case may have been rather a consequence of tvu misinterpretation\, essure contraceptive failure cannot be totally excluded and all reported events were considered as related to the suspect insert. this case was regarded as incident due to the reported serious injury (required intervention). product technical complaint (ptc) analysis concluded to an unconfirmed quality defect (no batch number was provided). medical ptc assessment considered that\, based on the available information\, there is no reason to suspect quality defect of the product. no further information is expected.,this case report from (b)(6) was derived from medical literature on 09-jan-2015 \, article entitled ""confirmation of essure placement using transvaginal ultrasound"". it refers to a female patient of unspecified age who had essure model 205 (fallopian tube occlusion insert) inserted for sterilization. bayer device essure was reported. case report: this female patient of an unspecified age had a complicated placement and a third device was placed after spontaneous expulsion of first device. violation of the control protocol occurred in that only tvu (transvaginal ultrasound) was performed instead of hsg (hysterosalpingogram) at 3 months. at this tvu\, the position of the devices was misinterpreted. she became pregnant and during laparoscopic sterilization after termination of pregnancy\, one device was located intramural under the serosa due to partial perforation and 1 was in the proper position in the contralateral tube. authors comment: the 24-month cumulative pregnancy rate was 3.86 per 1000 (4 of 1037 patients)\, which is lower than the cumulative pregnancy rate with laparoscopic sterilization methods. none of the 4 pregnancies was related to failure of the sterilization method when the device was properly placed; in 1\, the device was absent or incorrectly positioned and in 3\, there was noncompliance with the protocol. abstract: study objective: to evaluate the protocol for confirmation of satisfactory essure placement using transvaginal ultrasound. design: prospective multicenter cohort study (canadian task force classification ii-2). setting: outpatient departments of 4 teaching hospitals in the netherlands. patients: eleven hundred forty-five women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization using the essure device between march 2005 and december 2007. intervention: transvaginal ultrasound examination 12 weeks after uncomplicated successful bilateral placement or as indicated according to the transvaginal ultrasound protocol after 4 weeks\, and hysterosalpingography (hsg) at 12 weeks to confirm correct placement of the device after 3 months. measurements and main results: the rate of successful placement was 88.4% initially. in 164 women (15%)\, successful placement was confirmed at hsg according the protocol. in 9 patients (0.84%)\, incorrect position of the device was observed at hsg. the cumulative pregnancy rate after 18 months was 3.85 per thousand women. conclusion: transvaginal ultrasound should be the first diagnostic test used to confirm the adequacy of hysteroscopic essure sterilization because it is minimally invasive\, averts ionizing radiation\, and does not decrease the effectiveness of the essure procedure. other cases created from same article are 2015-003979\, 2015-004054\, 2015-004063\, 2015-004152 and 2015-004157. follow-up from 14-jan-2015: the physician reported that the batch numbers were not included in their database so he was afraid they were hard to find\, but he was going to make an effort. no further information was provided. ptc (product technical complaint) investigation result received on 21-jan-2015. the ptc global reference number for this report is (b)(4). final assessment: since no product was returned to us for investigation\, we were unable to perform an investigation of the actual device involved in this complaint. typically\, we would inspect the micro-insert to look for any manufacturing deficiencies. since we have no valid lot number for this case\, we were unable to conduct a review of the manufacturing batch record. we are unable to confirm any quality defect or device malfunction at this time. no new failure mode has been identified. medical assessment: this ptc was initiated due to a lack of efficacy and a usability issue. contraceptive failure may occur under the use of any contraceptive and is not indicative of a quality defect per se. in this particular case\, also complicated placement and expulsion of first device was reported. furthermore it was reported that only tvu (transvaginal ultrasound) was performed instead of hsg (hysterosalpingogram) to confirm tubal occlusion and that at this tvu\, the position of the devices was misinterpreted. the reported adverse events are known\, possible\, undesirable events and not indicative of a quality deficit per se. no batch number was reported. without this information no batch signal cluster review in the (b)(4) database for a more detailed statistical medical evaluation is possible. neither batch number nor complaint sample were available for further technical investigation. the technical assessment concluded unconfirmed quality defect. in summary\, there is no reason to suspect a causal relationship to a potential quality deficit based on this report. company causality comment: this case report was derived from medical literature and refers to a female patient who had a complicated essure 205 (fallopian tube occlusion insert) placement. she experienced a spontaneous expulsion of the first device and a third device was placed. later\, she became pregnant and during laparoscopic sterilization after termination of pregnancy;

the reporter believed the position of the devices was misinterpreted in this exam\, since patient became pregnant and a partial perforation was diagnosed during a laparoscopy. although pregnancy in this case may have been rather a consequence of tvu misinterpretation\, essure contraceptive failure cannot be totally excluded and all reported events were considered as related to the suspect insert. this case was regarded as incident due to the reported serious injury (required intervention). product technical complaint (ptc) analysis concluded to an unconfirmed quality defect (no batch number was provided). medical ptc assessment considered that\, based on the available information\, there is no reason to suspect quality defect of the product. further information is being sought.,.","[she experienced a spontaneous expulsion of the first device and a third device was placed., she experienced a spontaneous expulsion of the first device and a third device was placed.]",spontaneous expulsion;first device;third device;spontaneous expulsion;first device;third device
